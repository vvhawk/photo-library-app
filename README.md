# Photo Library 📸
Welcome to my first app! Here, you’ll find a traditional photo library reimagined as a colorful adventure!

This started as a project for my university class on software methodology. While we were only graded on functionality, my partner and I took it to the next level by prioritizing how it looked.  

With everything I create, I strive to make it pretty to look at. Design is essential to me. The basis for our design was to use colors to designate the application's various functions. I’ve included the initial storyboard and UML diagram from the planning phase. 

**NOTE:**  
*The application has a desktop and mobile(android) version with slightly different functionality. The README files serve as guides to these functionalities. If you have any further questions, feel free to [reach out](https://github.com/vvhawk)!*
