# Photo Library 📸
**NOTE:**  
*The application has a [desktop](./app(desktop)/README.md) and [mobile](./app(android)/README.md)  version with slightly different functionality. The README files serve as guides to these functionalities. If you have any further questions, feel free to [reach out](https://github.com/vvhawk)!*

Welcome to my first app! Here, you’ll find a traditional photo library reimagined as a colorful adventure!

This started as a project for my university class on [software methodology](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-213-software-methodology).  

With everything I create, I strive to give it a pretty face. Design is essential to me. The basis for our design was to use colors to convey the various components of the app. I’ve included the initial [Storyboard](./storyboard.pdf) and [UML diagram](./UML.pdf) from the planning phase.
