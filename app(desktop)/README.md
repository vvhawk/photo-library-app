## Overview
SnapVault gives you the power to create and manage albums directly from images stored on your computer. You can move and copy photos between your albums. You can edit your photos with captions and tags. You can even view your collection with a built-in slideshow. Above all, it supports multiple users! 

This application comes preconfigured with a stock user containing a stock album with five breathtaking stock photos.
